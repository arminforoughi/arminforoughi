WORK EXPERIENCE
University of California San Diego San Diego, CA
Laboratory Junior Data Scientist September 2021 - present
• Responsibilities: I perform a variety of data analysis related tasks, such as making graphs, image processing and building machine learning
algorithms. I mainly work with .Star and .MRC format files developed from a Cryogenic electron microscopy and run my algorithm in the
schools supercomputer through ssh cloud computing.
• Writing algorithm for MRC files: MRCs are a grayscale picture representation of a single protein. I wrote an algorithm that reads the MRCs
as a 2D array then it rotates and translates each MRC and uses in place comparison to another MRC to find its closest MRC match. This
creates an ordered single line of all MRCs that will be used to construct a 3D model of the protein.
• Writing algorithm for Star files: Star files are data frames of particles and their features that go into each MRC. I’m working on an
algorithm that uses a three layer neural network to identify the best particles that go in each MRC and the bad particles that should not be
used. A good particle is when it stays with one MRC and a bad one alters between MRCs. The algorithm looks at each iteration that CryoEm
runs to form an MRC, and uses sigmoid activation function for binary classification to Identify good versus bad particles.
CoderSchool Pleasanton, CA
Programing Coach July 2021 – Present
• Responsibilities: Teach Python to middle school and high school students. Mostly teach basic fundamentals of python, data structure, and
open-cv. Part time online while I’m working in the laboratory in UCSD
University of California San Diego School of Pharmacy San Diego, CA
Student intern January 2019 - January 2020
• Data analysis Internship: To research unknown adverse of effects of drugs using the FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) data
base, and find any new and crucial side effects of drugs by writing filter functions on Linux to search for a unique scenario of drug usage.
Analysing MDMA related deaths: There were nearly 50 deaths with MDMA usage, but after extensive research, we found out that less than
5 were directly related to MDMA.
UCSF Urology San Francisco, CA
Data Analysis Intern July 2019 – September 2019
• Responsibilities: Creating an Atlas of PSMA uptake for post -Proctectomy Patients. Contouring lesions or lymphadenitis in PET, MRI or CT
scans by using MIM platform, to analyze the most common places lesions can develop after a post -Proctectomy surgery.
Natera Inc San Carlos, CA
Clinical Data Operator July 2019 – September 2019
• Responsibilities: Create new orders on Laboratory Inventory Management System and perform necessary checks to ensure proper
accessioning. Accession samples with high accuracy and efficiency.
UCSF bioengineering Department of Surgery San Francisco, CA
Intern July 2018 – September 2018
• Responsibilities: Assist on building a surgical endoscopy with three degrees of freedom. Specified in improving lifting force and strength of
materials. Designing knuckles with AutoCAD and 3D printing them.
