## WORK EXPERIENCE
### University of California San Diego San Diego, CA
Laboratory Junior Data Scientist 
- Responsibilities: I perform a variety of data analysis related tasks, such as making graphs, image processing and building machine learning
algorithms. I mainly work with .Star and .MRC format files developed from a Cryogenic electron microscopy and run my algorithm in the
schools supercomputer through ssh cloud computing.
- Writing algorithm for MRC files: MRCs are a grayscale picture representation of a single protein. I wrote an algorithm that reads the MRCs
as a 2D array then it rotates and translates each MRC and uses in place comparison to another MRC to find its closest MRC match. This
creates an ordered single line of all MRCs that will be used to construct a 3D model of the protein.
- Writing algorithm for Star files: Star files are data frames of particles and their features that go into each MRC. Iâ€™m working on an
algorithm that uses a three layer neural network to identify the best particles that go in each MRC and the bad particles that should not be
used. A good particle is when it stays with one MRC and a bad one alters between MRCs. The algorithm looks at each iteration that CryoEm
runs to form an MRC, and uses sigmoid activation function for binary classification to Identify good versus bad particles.
